# Hope is Here

This is a progressive web application using Gatbsy for Black Family Resource Development, Inc. It connects to Contentful, a headless CMS, for content edits and additions.

## Getting Started

### Install

```
npm install
```

### Add Local `.env` Credentials

Create a file in the root directory with the following contents:

```
SITE_NAME = "http://localhost:8000"
ACCESS_TOKEN=
SPACE_ID=
ENVIRONMENT_ID = "master"
```

You will need to fill in the `ACCESS_TOKEN` and `SPACE_ID` for Contentful access. You can use the `ENVIRONMENT_ID` variable to point to a different environment/branch in Contentful.

### Run the Application Locally

```
npm run start
```

- After running this command, a file `src/gatsby-types.d.ts` should be autogenerated and your set-up is complete!

#### Default Local Hosting Info

- Development: **localhost:8000**
- Graphql playground: **localhost:8000/__graphql**
