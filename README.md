# Welcome to the BFDI Repo!
This is a progressive web appllication using Gatbsy for Black Family Resource Development, Inc. It connects to a headless CMS using Contentful for client survey edits and additions.
## Getting Started
 
### Install
```
   npm install
```
### 1password
- You will need access to the **BFDI Vault**. Ask your DLDL for access.
- 1password contains the **.env** file, along with **Contenful** login credentials
- For some, the 1password add-on is enough. For others, you may need to access 1password through the desktop app. [Download link](https://1password.com/downloads/mac/) || [1password Browser](https://start.1password.com/signin?l=en)
 
### Add local .env Credentials
```
   ACCESS_TOKEN=
   SPACE_ID=
   ENVIRONMENT_ID = "master"
   SITE_NAME = "http://localhost:8000"
   ENABLE_GATSBY_REFRESH_ENDPOINT = true
```

Make sure you are using the correct `ENVIRONMENT_ID` to reference the Space in Contentful you need.
